Generate exactly {num_flashcards} flashcards based on the following context. Follow these strict rules:
- Each flashcard must start with "Q:" followed by a complete question.
- Each question must be followed by "Answer:" and then a complete answer.
- Do not include any numbering or labels like "Card 1" or "Flashcard 2".
- Only output flashcards in this format â€” if you feel it is required you can add small explanations.
